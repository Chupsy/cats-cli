# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CATS-CLI. We welcome and appreciate all the help we can get!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

CATS-CLI is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into CATS-CLI itself.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities

-   Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
-   Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in the [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
-   Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
-   Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
-   Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
